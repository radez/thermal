This module provides mock data from heat so that development can happen off of
a full heat/openstack install. In general it provides a mock heat client object
and xml data that the calls to the rest api would return.

Add mock data and functionality to is as nessesary to make features work.

To use link this directory into the example projects directory named heat.

example_project $ ln -s ../heat_mock heat
